# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset using LSTM

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **sentiment classification model** using the **IMDB dataset** provided by TensorFlow. The model identifies whether a movie review expresses a **positive or negative sentiment**.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack & Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- IMDB Dataset (Tokenized)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Preprocessed the IMDB review data and padded sequences
- Built a deep learning model using LSTM layers
- Achieved high accuracy through architecture optimization
- Visualized training performance with accuracy and loss plots
- Suitable for real-time review sentiment prediction
